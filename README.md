Go-Moku or Five in line is a traditional oriental game, originally from China. 
The game consists of a grid of squares which can be any size as seen in the image below. Usually,
it is 19x19 and no smaller than 15x15. Players choose colors of their stones and decide who will 
play first. When playing with traditional white and black stones, black always goes first. 
The board starts empty. The first player then plays a single stone on the center intersection of 
the grid. Players then alternate playing 1 stone per turn. For this project we impose the restriction 
that the new stone has to be placed adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any of 
the existing stone. This is different from the traditional play-style where the new stone can be 
placed anywhere on the board. The objective of the game is to get five or more stones in a r
ow (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The first player to achieve this wins the game.
